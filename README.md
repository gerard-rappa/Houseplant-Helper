# Houseplant-Helper

Growing up on the east coast, I haven't had too many opportunities to procure and grow succulent plants, and since I am used to foliage/flowering plants, I tend to overwater them when I do get a hold of one. My goal with this project is to create a web application that enables me to monitor the soil moisture levels in my house plants, as well as keep track of when I last watered them. This is also my first time using both an arduino, for collecting the data, and a raspberry pi, to process the data, and act as a server for me to connect to and see my data from anywhere. 

## The Plant That Started It All
This is a cutting from some Rock Purslane (Cisanthe grandiflora) growing in my backyard.

## The Work In Progress
Here is the soil sensor I got in the mail yesterday...

...all hooked up to my arduino!

Ignore the box on the left under the volt meter. I use that for building and modding guitar pedals and it's secured to the same board that my breadboards are glued to.

I dipped the sensor in a cup of water in order to calibrate it, and you can see the results right underneath

My arduino kit came with a bunch of sensors, so I figured I might as well use one or two. Here is a temperature/humidity sensor, let's see how accurate it is...

Not too bad!

### The Current State
Before I stick the  moisture sensor in any soil, I'm going to want to make the top portion waterproof. I'll have plenty of time to decide how I want to do that while I start working on the web application portion of this project...
