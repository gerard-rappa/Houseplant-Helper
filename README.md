# Houseplant-Helper

Growing up on the east coast, I haven't had too many opportunities to procure and grow succulent plants, and since I am used to foliage and flowering plants, I tend to overwater them when I do get a hold of one. My goal with this project is to create a web application that enables me to monitor the soil moisture levels in my house plants, as well as keep track of when I last watered them. This is also my first time using both an arduino, for collecting the data, and a raspberry pi, to process the data, and act as a server for me to connect to and see my data from anywhere.
